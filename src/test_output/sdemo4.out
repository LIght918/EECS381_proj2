Ctor: "Xavier"
Thing 1 with ID 1 constructed
t1 is: Thing1-"Xavier"

Construct t2 from t1
Copy ctor: "Xavier"
t2 is: Thing1-"Xavier"

Construct t3 from an unnamed temporary
Ctor: "Cugat"
Thing 2 with ID 2 constructed
t3 is: Thing2-"Cugat"

Construct t4 from a function return value
in test_fn1:
Ctor: "Carmen"
Thing 3 with ID 3 constructed
t4 is: Thing3-"Carmen"

Assign t2 = t4
Copy assign from String:  "Carmen"
Copy ctor: "Carmen"
Dtor: "Xavier"
t2 now is: Thing3-"Carmen"

Assign t3 to returned function value
in test_fn1:
Ctor: "Carmen"
Thing 4 with ID 4 constructed
Move assign from String:  "Carmen"
Dtor: "Cugat"
t3 now is: Thing4-"Carmen"

Give t3 to a function that returns its by value parameter and set t4 to the returned value
Copy ctor: "Carmen"
In test_f2: by-value parameter t is: Thing4-"Carmen"
Assign by-value parameter t to a different value
Ctor: "Miranda"
Thing 5 with ID 5 constructed
Move assign from String:  "Miranda"
Dtor: "Carmen"
t now is: Thing5-"Miranda"
Return the by-value parameter by value
Move ctor: "Miranda"
Move assign from String:  "Miranda"
Dtor: "Carmen"
Dtor: ""
t4 now is: Thing5-"Miranda"
